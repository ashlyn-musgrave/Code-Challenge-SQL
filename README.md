# 100 Days of Code Challenge (SQL)

100 Days of Code Challenge (SQL)

I'm embarking on my 100 days of code challenge on November 15, 2022 

**Intention:** The purpose of embarking on this challenge is to improve my SQL querying skills in order to become a better Data Analyst and Cloud Engineer.

**Challenge Outline:** For the first 30 days of this challenge, I plan to practice my fundamental SQL skills that I've learned throughout my bootcamps to become intimately familiar with SQL basics. For this challenge, I've chosen to use datasets found on the Internet and will eventually create Tableau and Power BI projects with my data insights. Depending on my confidence level after the first 30 days, I would like to dive into a cloud related project to start building my portfolio and increasing my knowledge of programming services and features for the cloud. 

**Rules:** 

     1. Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
     2. Tweet my progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag (@ashlynintech)
     3. Update my GitHub repo daily with my progress
